**Spring Boot Demo App**

This repository is a demo of the Spring Boot.

**Building a Spring Boot Web Application**
Think about building a simple web application using Spring. You’re probably going to want to:

Use Spring of course!
Spring MVC for the web part.
Thymeleaf for the template engine, because you're just plain tired of using JSPs.
Good old Hibernate for your ORM.
An H2 database as your development database.
Spring Data to take the pain out of using Good Old Hibernate.
Spring Security to secure your web application.
Tomcat as your application server.


**Why Thymeleaf ?**
Traditionally, Spring MVC applications used Java Server Pages, or JSPs to generate html content. 
JSPs are a mature technology and has been around since the early days of Java. 
In terms of raw speed, JSPs are hard to beat too. 
But when you do not need the absolute raw speed of a JSP, you may want to consider alternatives to JSPs which help improve developer productivity.
 
JSPs offer an HTML ‘like’ syntax. Meaning its close, but not completely compatible with HTML. 
Thymeleaf on the other hand, aims to be a "Natural Template". 
This means the Thymeleaf template file will open and display normally in a browser, while a JSP file does not.
